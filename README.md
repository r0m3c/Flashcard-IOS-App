## Flashcards

## Lab 3

### App Description
To begin, some new additions that I have added to my app are being able to give the user the ability to browse through multiple flashcards. Of course, the user will have to manually add a newcard, but then after that I've added "next" and "prev" buttons that will enable the user to switch back and forth between all flashcards they desire. These buttons will be turned on/off depending on how many flashcards there are. Also, a new addition was added where after the user closes the app, any flashcards they have already made will be saved and will be on the app when they desire to open it back up. Moreover, now the user can delete a flashcard by pressing the "❌" button to delete any flaschard they desire. This will erase it from the app entirely. Lastly, the user will also have the ability to store multiple choice flashcards if they so desire. In summary, this has app has full functionality that the user can use on a regular basis.

## Lab 2

### App Description
To begin, the first new addition added to my app is the ability to press the “+” button, which will lead you to another screen (creation screen) where the user can add a new flashcard into the main screen. The user has the option to change the question, and all three choices that come up in the flashcard. As a heads up, make sure that you leave none of the text fields open, because if you do, you will get an error if you leave any blank. Make sure to insert something in the text fields. Moving on, in the creation screen, the user is able to press the “cancel” button at the top right to immediately leave that screen and go back to the main screen whenever you choose to. Furthermore, a new addition was added to manually edit the flashcard in the main screen by pressing the “✏️” button. Pressing this button will take you to the creation screen, where all text fields will be filled up with the current information that was in the main screen. Here the user will be able to edit the current flashcard. Also, no fields can be left empty, as you will get an error message. To end, a few new functionalities have been added to give the user more flexibility and choices.

## Lab 1

### App Description
In what I have named “Flashcards”, to be my app, you will see an ominous dark red background. I chose this color because I decided that my question was to be “What is my favorite film?”. I am a big cinephile so the answer to this question was chosen instantly. My favorite film is “Schindler’s List.” You might have heard of it, and if you have then you know that it was a very sad film, hence the choice of my colors as the background and the border layers of the boxes. I’ve also styled dark shadows surrounding the box to further amplify the dark mood that I am trying to portray. As to the functionality of the app, I’ve included multiple choice choices so the user can guess which film is my favorite. For example, if the user picks the choices “Lincoln” and Portrait of a Lady on Fire”, once they press them, they would get a response of “Try Again.” Once they choose the correct answer, “Schindler’s List”, an option would come up that says “Correct!”. The user can also click back and forth between the labels “Schindler’s List” and “Correct!”. All of these choices are chosen by tapping on the desired choice. In summary, this is a simple app that gives the user a set question, with the option of letting them choose the correct answer.
