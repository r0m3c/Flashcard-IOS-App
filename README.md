## Lab 1

### App Description
In what I have named “Flashcards”, to be my app, you will see an ominous dark red background. I chose this color because I decided that my question was to be “What is my favorite film?”. I am a big cinephile so the answer to this question was chosen instantly. My favorite film is “Schindler’s List.” You might have heard of it, and if you have then you know that it was a very sad film, hence the choice of my colors as the background and the border layers of the boxes. I’ve also styled dark shadows surrounding the box to further amplify the dark mood that I am trying to portray. As to the functionality of the app, I’ve included multiple choice choices so the user can guess which film is my favorite. For example, if the user picks the choices “Lincoln” and Portrait of a Lady on Fire”, once they press them, they would get a response of “Try Again.” Once they choose the correct answer, “Schindler’s List”, an option would come up that says “Correct!”. The user can also click back and forth between the labels “Schindler’s List” and “Correct!”. All of these choices are chosen by tapping on the desired choice. In summary, this is a simple app that gives the user a set question, with the option of letting them choose the correct answer.
